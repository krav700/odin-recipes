                <li>2 cups chopped yellow onion</li>
                <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>

                <li>2 cups frozen cut green beans, thawed</li>
                <li>2 cups frozen sweet corn, thawed</li>
                <li>1 ½ pounds frozen tater tots</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Lawry's®)</li>
                <li>½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>

            <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

            <ol class="steps_list">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
                <li>Set a large deep cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and swirl to coat skillet evenly. Add onions to skillet in one even layer; top with ground beef, breaking it up into small pieces. Cook undisturbed until onions are translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir beef and onions until well combined, and cook until beef is cooked through and browned, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes longer.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium. Season beef with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 1 more minute. Remove from heat. Add cream of mushroom soup, green beans, and corn; stir until well combined.</li>
                <li>Toss tater tots and seasoned salt in a bowl to combine. Arrange tater tots decoratively over beef mixture in the skillet, avoiding large gaps between tots.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tater tots are golden and crisp, about 1 hour. Sprinkle with cheese and scallions; cool 10 minutes before serving.</li>
